# My Personal "HelloWorld" VHDL FPGA Learning Playground

## Getting Started

 To build this project you will need Altera Quartus II, Altera USB Blaster and A-C4E6 Cyclone IVe FPGA development board. Also an Eclipse IDE (CDT) with Veditor plugin will come handy if you want to change VHDL projects source code. 
 To start, you can just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/startupit69/HelloLCD1602.git
cd HelloLCD1602/quartus
make clean
make
make program
```

The result on your A-C4E6 board should be something like this:
